It’s a great action flick, it’s paced well so it has your attention drawn throughout and the end is somewhat emotional. Not everyone can make it sorta thing, but it is a hopeful conclusion. An emotional zombie flick.\n",

    "    Review: Avengers: Endgame is not just a movie; it's an epic culmination of over a decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe films. It's a story of sacrifice, heroism, and redemption that pays off the emotional and narrative investment of 22 films. The directors, the Russo Brothers, have masterfully woven together multiple storylines, delivering an emotionally charged and action-packed finale. The performances are powerful, the visual effects are spectacular, and the narrative is both satisfying and heart-wrenching. Endgame serves as a fitting farewell to some of Marvel's most beloved characters, leaving audiences both cheering and in tears.\n",
