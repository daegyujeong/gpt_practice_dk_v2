The backdoor manipulated sshd, the executable file used to make remote ... That operation matches the style of the XZ Utils backdoor far more than the cruder supply chain attacks of APT41 or Lazarus, by comparison. \"It could very well be someone else,\" says Aitel. A backdoor was planted in the XZ utils package, a popular open-source compression utility for Linux/UNIX systems, by a threat actor named JiaT75. The backdoor exploited the SSH protocol to gain remote access and control over affected devices. The xz-utils package, used by many Linux distributions, had a backdoor that could compromise sshd authentication. Learn how to check and update your Kali installation to avoid this issue. A malicious developer inserted a complex backdoor into the open-source library XZ Utils, which affects many Linux distributions and enables remote code execution. Learn how the backdoor works, how to identify it, and what actions to take to protect your systems.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m\n",

The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution capabilities on the affected Linux system.

      "Summary: A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a \"homunculus computer\"—a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology). Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.\n",
      "A backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have \"legitimate\" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.\n",
      "Many systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system. Default passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version. In 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system, the Clipper chip, with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access. The chip was unsuccessful.\n",
      "Recent proposals to counter backdoors include creating a database of backdoors' triggers and then using neural networks to detect them.\n",
